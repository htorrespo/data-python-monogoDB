# Working with Data

Working with data details the earliest processes of data science problem solving. The 1st step is to identify the problem, which determines all else that needs to be done. The 2nd step is to gather data. The 3rd step is to wrangle (munge) data, which is critical. Wrangling is getting data into a form that is useful for machine learning and other data science problems. Of course, wrangled data will probably have to be cleaned. The 4th step is to visualize the data. Visualization helps you get to know the data and, hopefully, identify patterns.

## One-Dimensional Data Example

The code example generates visualizations of two very common data distributionsâ€”uniform and normal. The uniform distribution has constant probability. That is, all events that belong to the distribution are equally probable. The normal distribution is symmetrical about the center, which means that 50% of its values are less than the mean and 50% of its values are greater than the mean. Its shape resembles a bell curve . The normal distribution is extremely important because it models many naturally occurring events.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

if __name__ == "__main__":
    plt.figure('Uniform Distribution')
    uniform = np.random.uniform(-3, 3, 1000)
    count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(uniform, 20, facecolor="lime")
    plt.xlabel('Interval: [-3, 3]')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('Uniform Distribution')
    plt.axis([-3,3,0,100])
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.figure('Normal Distribution')
    normal = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
    count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(normal, 20, facecolor="fuchsia")
    plt.xlabel('Interval: [-3, 3]')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('Normal Distribution')
    plt.axis([-3,3,0,140])
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```

The code example begins by importing matplotlib and numpy. The main block begins by creating a figure and data for a uniform distribution. Next, a histogram is created and plotted based on the data. A figure for a normal distribution is then created and plotted. See Figures 5-1 and 5-2.
