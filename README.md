Data Science Fundamentals for Python and MongoDB

The book is a necessary precursor to applying and implementing machine learning algorithms. 

The book is self-contained. All of the math, statistics, stochastic, and programming skills required to master the content are covered. In-depth knowledge of object-oriented programming isn’t required because complete examples are provided and explained.

What You'll Learn:

- Prepare for a career in data science

- Work with complex data structures in Python

- Simulate with Monte Carlo and Stochastic algorithms

- Apply linear algebra using vectors and matrices

- Utilize complex algorithms such as gradient descent and principal component analysis

- Wrangle, cleanse, visualize, and problem solve with data

- Use MongoDB and JSON to work with data


The book is a necessary precursor to applying and implementing machine learning algorithms, because it introduces the reader to foundational principles of the science of data.

The book is self-contained. All the math, statistics, stochastic, and programming skills required to master the content are covered in the book. In-depth knowledge of object-oriented programming isn’t required, because working and complete examples are provided and explained. The examples are in-depth and complex when necessary to ensure the acquisition of appropriate data science acumen. The book helps you to build the foundational skills necessary to work with and understand complex data science algorithms.

The book is organized into six chapters. Chapter  1 introduces the programming fundamentals with “Python” necessary to work with, transform, and process data for data science applications. Chapter  2 introduces Monte Carlo simulation for decision making, and data distributions for statistical processing. Chapter  3 introduces linear algebra applied with vectors and matrices. Chapter  4 introduces the gradient descent algorithm that minimizes (or maximizes) functions, which is very important because most data science problems are optimization problems. Chapter  5 focuses on munging, cleaning, and transforming data for solving data science problems. Chapter  6 focusing on exploring data by dimensionality reduction, web scraping, and working with large data sets efficiently.

Python programming code for all coding examples and data files are available for viewing and download through Apress at www.apress.com/9781484235966 or https://github.com/Apress/data-science-fund-for-python-and-mongodb. Specific linking instructions are included on the copyright pages of the book.

To install a Python module, pip is the preferred installer program. So, to install the matplotlib module from an Anaconda prompt: pip install matplotlib. Anaconda is a widely popular open source distribution of Python (and R) for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing that simplifies package management and deployment. I have worked with other distributions with unsatisfactory results, so I highly recommend Anaconda.
