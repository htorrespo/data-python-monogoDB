Data Science Fundamentals for Python and MongoDB

The book is a necessary precursor to applying and implementing machine learning algorithms. 

The book is self-contained. All of the math, statistics, stochastic, and programming skills required to master the content are covered. In-depth knowledge of object-oriented programming isn’t required because complete examples are provided and explained.

What You'll Learn:

- Prepare for a career in data science

- Work with complex data structures in Python

- Simulate with Monte Carlo and Stochastic algorithms

- Apply linear algebra using vectors and matrices

- Utilize complex algorithms such as gradient descent and principal component analysis

- Wrangle, cleanse, visualize, and problem solve with data

- Use MongoDB and JSON to work with data
